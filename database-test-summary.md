# Database Testing Summary

## Tests Performed

1. **Prisma Schema Validation**
   - Validated schema with \
   - Created and ran model structure validation tests

2. **Mock Database Tests**
   - Created mock implementations of Prisma Client
   - Tested user and product model operations
   - Validated query responses

3. **Seed Script Validation**
   - Validated seed data structure with tests
   - Ensured proper data relationships

4. **Jest Integration Tests**
   - Ran all database-related tests with Jest

## Results

All tests passed successfully. The Prisma schema is valid and correctly structured.

## Connection Issues

Note: Direct database connection testing was not possible due to authentication issues with 
PostgreSQL. The tests we ran use mocking to validate database functionality without requiring
an actual database connection.

## Next Steps

To perform full integration testing with the database:

1. Configure PostgreSQL with correct credentials
2. Add database connection string to .env file
3. Create integration tests that connect to a test database
4. Add database reset/cleanup in test setup and teardown
